# Python-ChatAPI

This Is a Python API to Create a very basic ChatApp using **JSONBin** as a storage Method.

# Usage
You can use this to Build a Basic ChatApp and use a JSOBin to store Users and Messages.
The Project runs on a Flask Server and can therefore be called from any other Programming Language and System. You will also need to change the Adress of the JSONBin in [server.py](https://github.com/CSL-Koga/Python-ChatAPI/blob/main/Backend/app.py) to your own bin. There is a standart one but you cant do anything too special with it.

# Example
There is a Example WebUI which can be found in [/Frontend](https://github.com/CSL-Koga/Python-ChatAPI/tree/main/Frontend)
There you can see how such a system might be interfaced with and used. To use it just start the Flask server in [/Backend](https://github.com/CSL-Koga/Python-ChatAPI/tree/main/Backend) using the command line; `Flask run -p 80`
