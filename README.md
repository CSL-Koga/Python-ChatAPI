# Python-ChatAPI
This Is a Python API to Create a very basic ChatApp using JSONBin as a storage Method.

You can use this to Build a Basic ChatApp and use a JSOBin to store Users and Messages.
The Project runs on a Flask Server and can therefore be called from any other Programming Language and System.

There is a Example WebUI which can be found in /Frontend
There you can see how such a system might be interfaced with and used. To use it just start the Flask server in /Backend using the command line, 'flask run'.
